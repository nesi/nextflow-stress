1. Sequential Write Performance: Tests how quickly the filesystem can write large files sequentially with different block sizes and thread counts.
2. Sequential Read Performance: Evaluates the speed of sequential read operations.
3. Random Read/Write Mix: Tests a mixed workload with 70% reads and 30% writes to simulate more realistic usage patterns.
4. Metadata Operations: Tests the filesystem's handling of many small files and metadata operations.
5. Concurrent File Access: Evaluates how well the filesystem handles multiple processes accessing the same file.
6. I/O Streaming Test: Simulates real-world data streaming workloads for both ingestion and processing.
